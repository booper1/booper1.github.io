        About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I'm a computer science student with a background in engineering.
            My goal is to work at an established company where I can feel invested in the work and valued as an individual.
            I have completed an 8-month software development internship at a multinational organization,
                during which I contributed to the development of multiple internal web applications.

            Problem-solving and creating high-quality products are my passions.
            I have a strong dedication to seeing projects through to completion,
                and I enjoy using my skills and knowledge to solve complex challenges.
            My background in robotics helped me discover my love for problem-solving and STEM fields.

            In my free time,
                I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and am always seeking opportunities to learn and improve my skills as a software developer.
            In the future,
                I look forward to traveling and learning new languages.
            I also plan on continuing to develop my RPG fan game,
                creating an immersive and engaging experience for players.
