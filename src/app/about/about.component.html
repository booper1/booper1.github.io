                About Me
            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm a computer science student with a background in engineering and robotics,
                which helped me discover my love for problem-solving and STEM fields.
                I have 8 months of software development internship experience,
                during which I contributed to the development of multiple internal web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Problem-solving and creating high-quality products are my passions.
                I have a strong dedication to seeing projects through to completion,
                and I enjoy using my skills and knowledge to solve complex challenges.
                My goal for after graduating is to work at an established company where I can feel invested in the work and valued as an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of my skills and experience,
                I have a strong foundation in computer science and engineering principles.
                Most of my professional experience is in Angular web applications;
                however, I'm always open to new experiences and opportunities to learn new things.
                Currently, I'm working on expanding my knowledge of front-end design and styling.
