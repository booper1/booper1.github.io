            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I'm a computer science student with a background in engineering and robotics,
                which helped me discover my love for problem-solving and STEM fields.
            I have 8 months of software development internship experience,
                during which I contributed to the development of multiple internal web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem-solving and creating high-quality products are my passions.
            I have a strong dedication to seeing projects through to completion,
                and I enjoy using my skills and knowledge to solve complex challenges.
            My goal for after graduating is to work at an established company where I can feel invested in the work and valued as an individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of my skills and experience,
                I have a strong foundation in computer science and engineering principles.
            Most of my professional experience is in Angular web apps paired with a .NET back-end platform.
            That being said, I'm always open to new experiences and opportunities to learn new things.
            I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge of front-end design and styling.
